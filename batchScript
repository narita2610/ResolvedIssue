â– Issue 01: Batch file always output "ECHO is off"
+ Reason: Before and After of assignment operator have 'blank space'
+ Resolved method: delete blank space
Ex:
+ Error script:
  -----------------------
  @echo off
  set mess = hello world
  echo %mess%
  pause
  -----------------------
+ Resolved script:
  -----------------------
  @echo off
  set mess=hello world
  echo %mess%
  pause
  -----------------------
